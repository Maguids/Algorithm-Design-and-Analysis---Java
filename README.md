## Objectives of this course:

1. Asymptotic analysis of algorithms: Big O notation (O, Ω and Θ), execution time estimates, analysis of iterative and recursive programs;
2. Sorting: sorting as a basic part of other algorithms, comparative and non-comparative algorithms, binary search and direct and indirect applications;
3. Algorithm design techniques: exhaustive search, greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming;
4. Some specialized data structures: priority queues, disjoint sets;
5. Balanced binary search trees: Red-Black trees.
6. Graph algorithms: graph representation, depth and breadth searches, minimum cost support tree, minimum distances, maximum flow.
7. Computationally difficult problems. Brief introduction to the complexity classes of P, NP, NP-hard and NP-Complete problems. Introduction to approximation and parametric algorithms.
